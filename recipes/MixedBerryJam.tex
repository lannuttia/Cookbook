\begin{recipe}{Mixed Berry Jam}{40 Spoons}{32 Minutes}
    \ingredient[450]{g}{frozen berries}
    \ingredient[450]{g}{Sugar}
    \ingredient[450]{tbsp}{Lemon Juice}
    Put all the ingredients in a large saucepan, and let stand for at least one
    hour as the fruit defrosts. This can be overnight. Heat the mixture on a
    very low heat to allow the sugar to dissolve and the fruit to release its
    juice. Stir gently occasionally. Heat jam jars in a low oven to sterilize at
    220 \degrees{}F. Once all the sugar has dissolved, turn up the hob and heat
    the jam quickly to a rolling boil. After a couple of minutes, start testing
    the jam's set by using a thermometer to check and see if the jam has reached
    221 \degrees{}F. Once the jam has reached the setting point, turn off the heat
    and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes. This allows the jam to thicken
    slightly, so that the fruit pieces don't all float to the top in the jars.
    Spoon the jam into the hot jars and seal the lids. Allow to cool completely.
    Label and start enjoying fresh, three ingredient frozen mixed berry jam!
