\begin{recipe}{Chocolate Chip Cookies}{36 Cookies}{30 minutes}
    Preheat oven to 375 \degrees{}F. Line three baking sheets with parchment
    paper and set aside.
    \ingredient[3]{Cups}{All-Purpose Flour}
    \ingredient[1]{tsp}{Baking Soda}
    \ingredient[1/2]{tsp}{Baking Powder}
    \ingredient[1]{tsp}{Sea Salt}
    In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set
    aside.
    \ingredient[1]{Cup}{Softened Salted Butter}
    \ingredient[1]{Cup}{Granulated Sugar}
    \ingredient[1]{Cup}{Packed Light Brown}
    Cream together butter and sugars until combined.
    \ingredient[2]{tsp}{Pure Vanilla Extract}
    \ingredient[2]{}{Large Eggs}
    Beat in eggs and vanilla extract until light. This will likely take about 1
    minute. After this, start mixing in the dry ingredients until combined.
    \ingredient[2]{Cups}{Chocolate Chips}
    Add chocolate chips and mix well. Roll 2 -- 3 tbsp balls of dough, flatten
    slightly and then place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.
    Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8 -- 10 minutes. Take them out
    when they are just \textbf{barely} starting to turn brown. Let them sit on
    the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
